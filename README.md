# DelhiClimateAnalysis
Analysis of Delhi's weather trends, focusing on temperatures and dew points, to uncover seasonal patterns and climate changes. Insights support urban planning and climate action.
Climate analysis is important to understand the environmental trends and their impacts on urban regions, especially in fast-growing cities like Delhi. The aim of this project is to analyze the weather patterns of Delhi over a period of six years from June 2018 to June 2024. With increasing concerns about climate change, rising temperatures, and urban heat islands, it has become imperative to evaluate regional climate data to uncover patterns, seasonal trends, and anomalies.

This project uses historical data on weather, which are maximum and minimum temperatures, "feels like" temperature, and dew point values. This method preprocessed the database to deal with missing entries as well as those with partially filled information to make the analytical work continuous and error free. The data is thus linearly interpolated and later graphed to see how things have changed climatically.

This analysis is supposed to clearly bring out the evolution of the climate in Delhi over the recent years and important observations like fluctuations in temperatures, seasonal changes, and possible impacts on the local population. This can benefit urban planning, environmental policies, and measures for countering the adverse impacts of climate change.

This section prepares for a more detailed analysis presented in the following parts to define the scope, objectives, and significance of the current project in addressing the climate change challenges faced by the world today.
